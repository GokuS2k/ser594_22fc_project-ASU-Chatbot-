**Description**: A chatbot is a software program that communicates with humans with the help of natural language. The program must get real-time input from the user. With the provided information, it should give an appropriate reply to the user. This program will analyze the input questions, regarding the university's admission, and respond appropriately to its user. The input and output should be text data. Sometimes, both the input and the output could be alphanumeric.

**Intellectual Merit**: A chatbot might not be ready with the response all the time. When the user asks the questions such as admission requirements, student population per class, documents necessary for the admission committee, etc., the chatbot might not give the desired response. In this case, the program will check for keywords from the question, look for the answers from third-party websites (by scraping) such as *Quora* or *Empowerly*, and give the appropriate response.

**Data Sourcing**: For this project, we can create our response texts. Since this chatbot is for an educational institution, it should prepare the response texts for the following questions: Degrees offered, program names, Tuition fees, scholarships, etc.

**Related Work**: A Smart Chatbot Architecture based NLP and Machine Learning for Health Care Assistance (DOI: 10.1145/3386723.3387897)
