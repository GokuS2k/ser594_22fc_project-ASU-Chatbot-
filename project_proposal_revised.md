**Keywords**: Chatbot, Natural Language, Artificial  Intelligence, Keyword matching


**Description**: A chatbot is a software program that communicates with humans with the help of natural language. The program must get real-time input from the user. With the provided information, it should give an appropriate reply to the user. This program will analyze the input questions, regarding the university's admission, and respond appropriately to its user. The input and output should be text data. Sometimes, both the input and the output could be alphanumeric.


**Research Questions**: 

-RO1: To capture the trends in chatbot ratings given by the customers.

-RO2: To predict the number of unanswered questions as an indicator to the ratings given by the customers.

-RO3: To support the model's capacity for making predictions that achieve RO2.

-RO4: To evaluate the casual relationship between each customer rating matrics, for example, *Efficiency* and *Accuracy*.


**Intellectual Merit**: A chatbot might not be ready with the response all the time. When the user asks the questions regarding the university location, research output, etc the chatbot refers the text dataset for appropriate answers. But when the user asks questions about number of students in a particular campus, the program will check for keywords from the question, scrap the answers from the ASU website using requests and BeautifulSoup, and give the appropriate response.


**Data Sourcing**: For this project, we can create our response texts. Since this chatbot is for an educational institution, it should prepare the response texts for the following questions: Origin of the Unoversity, rankings, research output, Campuses and locations.
